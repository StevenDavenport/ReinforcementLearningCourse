# Notebook Template (Reinforcement Learning Public Course)

Use this structure for every notebook; skip sections only if truly unnecessary.

## Title
- Short, descriptive, learner‑friendly

## 0. Snapshot (1 page max)
- Why this matters now (real use case)
- What you will learn (3–5 bullets)
- Prereqs (math + coding)
- Estimated time

## 1. Core Idea (intuition first)
- Plain‑language explanation
- Key terms/vocabulary
- Minimal math (only the essentials)

## 2. Worked Example (toy environment)
- Define the environment
- Show one full step/episode
- Walk through an update by hand

## 3. Code Path A (beginner)
- Run provided code
- Change 1–2 knobs (e.g., epsilon, gamma, learning rate)
- Observe and plot results

## 4. Code Path B (intermediate)
- Implement a key function (e.g., update rule or policy evaluation)
- Add logging or metrics
- Compare outcomes to Code Path A

## 5. Optional Deep Dive (advanced)
- Full derivation or proof
- Edge cases / limitations
- Links to primary sources

## 6. Exercises (tiered)
- Tier 1 (5–10 min): concept checks (2–3)
- Tier 2 (15–30 min): small coding change (1)
- Tier 3 (30–60 min): extension/ablation study (1)

## 7. Takeaways
- 3–5 bullets
- Common pitfalls

## 8. What’s Next
- Next notebook
- Suggested readings
