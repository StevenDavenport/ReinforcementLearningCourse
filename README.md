# Reinforcement Learning — Public Course

Welcome. This course is a notebook‑first introduction to reinforcement learning, designed for learners who want both theory and hands‑on practice. It starts with intuition and real‑world motivation, then builds toward formal methods and modern deep RL.

## Who this is for
- People considering further study in RL or AI
- Practitioners with a technical background who want a structured RL path
- Learners who want both math and code, with practical examples

## How to follow the course
1. Work through the notebooks in order.
2. Use the beginner path when you want intuition and runnable code.
3. Use the intermediate path to implement key algorithms.
4. Use the optional deep dives for full derivations and theory.

Each notebook includes:
- A real‑world motivation
- A worked example or toy environment
- Runnable code
- Tiered exercises (concept checks → coding → extensions)

## What you’ll be able to do
By the end, you should be able to:
- Explain the core RL concepts and tradeoffs
- Implement and evaluate classic RL algorithms
- Understand the differences between model‑free and model‑based methods
- Read modern RL papers with confidence

## Notes
Notebooks are designed to be read top‑to‑bottom and executed in a standard Python environment.
